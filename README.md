# Project Euler solutions written in Java by Karen Lo.

## *Project Euler Finished Problems:*
#### - Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
Finds the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 using a for loop and a nested if, else if loop.
#### - Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
Finds the sum of  the even-valued terms under 4 million in the Fibonacci sequence using a while loop and a nested if loop.
#### - Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor
Finds the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 using a while loop nested within a for loop.
#### - Problem 4: Largest Palindrome Product
Finds the largest palindrome product of two 3-digit numbers using nested for loops and an if loop.
#### - Problem 5: Smallest Multiple
Finds the smallest positive number that can be evenly divided by all numbers from 1 through factorRange. As of now, factorRange=20, thus it finds the smallest number divisible by 1-20.
#### - Problem 6: Sum Square Difference
Finds the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
#### - Problem 7: 1001st prime
Finds the 1001st prime.
#### - Problem 8: Largest Product in a Series
Finds the thirteen adjacent digits in the Problem8num.txt file that have the greatest product and returns that product.
#### - Problem 9: Special Pythagorean Triplet
Finds the one Pythagorean triplet where a+b+c=100 and returns the product of abc.
#### - Problem 10: Summation of Primes
Finds the sum of all the primes below two million.
#### - Problem 11: Largest Product in a Grid
Finds the largest product of n adjacent numbers in a grid in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally).
#### - Problem 12: Highly Divisible Triangular Number
Finds the first triangular number with over n divisors.
