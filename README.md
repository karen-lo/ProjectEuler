Project Euler solutions written in Java by Karen Lo.

Project Euler Finished Problems:
- Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
	Finds the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 using a for loop and a nested if, else if loop.
- Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
	Finds the sum of  the even-valued terms under 4 million in the Fibonacci sequence using a while loop and a nested if loop.
- Problem 3: Largest Prime Factor
	Finds the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 using a while loop nested within a for loop.
- Problem 4: Largest Palindrome Product
	Finds the largest palindrome product of two 3-digit numbers using nested for loops and an if loop.
- Problem 5: Smallest Multiple
	Finds the smallest positive number that can be evenly divided by all numbers from 1 through factorRange. As of now, factorRange=20, thus it finds the smallest number divisible by 1-20.
- Problem 6: Sum Square Difference
	Finds the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
- Problem 7: 1001st prime
	Finds the 1001st prime.
- Problem 8: Largest Product in a Series
	Finds the thirteen adjacent digits in the Problem8num.txt file that have the greatest product and returns that product.
- Problem 9: Special Pythagorean Triplet
	Finds the one Pythagorean triplet where a+b+c=100 and returns the product of abc.
